# Decision Record: Utility Function Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need utility functions for common operations like JSON file handling and timestamp formatting that work consistently across our TypeScript and Python implementations.

## Decision
We will implement parallel utility functions in both languages with consistent interfaces:

1. File operations: `load_json_file`/`loadJsonFile` and `save_json_file`/`saveJsonFile`
2. Time handling: `format_timestamp`/`formatTimestamp` and `parse_timestamp`/`parseTimestamp`
3. Repository operations: `load_repository`/`loadRepository` and `save_repository`/`saveRepository`
4. Logging: A `Logger` class with `info`, `warning`, and `error` methods

## Consequences
- Consistent API across language implementations
- Simplified cross-language development
- Reduced cognitive load when switching between languages
- Easier testing with predictable interfaces
