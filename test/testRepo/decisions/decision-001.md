# Decision Record: Data Model Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to establish a consistent data model architecture for the application that supports both TypeScript and Python implementations.

## Decision
We will implement a base model pattern with inheritance for all data entities:

1. Create abstract base models (`BaseModel`) in both TypeScript and Python
2. Implement concrete models that extend the base model
3. Use interfaces in TypeScript to define the contract
4. Use consistent serialization methods (`to_dict`/`toDict` and `from_dict`/`fromDict`)

## Consequences
- Consistent patterns across language implementations
- Clear inheritance hierarchy
- Simplified serialization/deserialization
- Type safety in TypeScript through interfaces

## References
- Repository class in Python
- IRepository interface in TypeScript
- BaseModel abstract class in both languages
