# Test Repository for ARC V1

This is a simple test repository for validating the ARC V1 extension. It contains both TypeScript and Python files with classes and functions that evolve over multiple commits.

## Structure

- `src/ts/`: TypeScript files
- `src/py/`: Python files

## Commit History

This repository has a series of commits that modify different files, allowing us to test the temporal knowledge graph construction and querying.

## Usage

This repository is intended for testing the ARC V1 extension's ability to:
1. Capture Git commit history
2. Parse code structure using tree-sitter
3. Build a temporal knowledge graph
4. Link decision records to code elements
5. Surface relevant context in VS Code panels
